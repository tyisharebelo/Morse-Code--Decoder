/**
 * Notice that we have eight pins, so we can represent the pins that
 * should be turned on as 8-bit values. The uint8_t type specifically
 * refers to an unsigned 8-bit integer. When individual bits are used
 * to represent data it's known as a bitfield.
 *
 * We can then use bitwise operations and bitmasks to interpret these bitfields.
 *
 * Additionally, placing these in an array allows us to define values
 * from 0 - 4 such that we can get the bitfield for a given number by
 * simply indexing the array!
 *
 * (These bitfields are defined in the ordering of the ALL_SEGMENTS array
 * in the header file, i.e., from A in the most-significant bit to G, then
 * DP in the least-significant bit.)
 *
 * If it's not clear to you how these values work, check the diagram on Labsheet 6 or
 * page 2 of the datasheet linked at the top of seven_segment.h.
